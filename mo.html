		<div class="top-box top-box-a">
			<p>The quest for standardisation is one that the Authority has always taken seriously and pursued vigorously over the years.  This is largely because the issue of substandard devices and its impact on consumers is one that the Authority consider critical.</p>

			<p>It is for that purpose that the Authority established the Type Approval Labs to protect the health and safety of the Consumer.  We needed to ensure that electronic communications equipment used on the Ghanaian market are safe, and to also assure our people that the telecommunications space is safe.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<p>It is particularly thrilling for us that on the continent, we are one of the few Regulators who have established this lab and the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) is partnering with us to train other regulators on the continent and across the world.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<p>The NCA is in the process of drafting Type Approval 
			regulations to streamline type approval activities.  This is the first time that is being done and we are happy to be executing our mandate to the benefit of the industry, government and consumers especially.</p>
