			<h4><b>Ensuring And Enhancing Consumer Satisfaction and creating a fair and efficient sector for the various players, palying our role in Government's Digital Economy Agenda, and helping develop Africa's telecommunication's sector are some of the key priorities that drive the work we do here at the National Communication Authority (NCA).</b></h4>
		</div>
			<div class="top-box ab-klu-b">
			<p>We have over the years continued to demonstrate our commitment to living our Values, vision, and Mission and above all mandate as enshrined in Act 769 - the establishing Act of the NCA.  The Authority has continued to do these through 2019 by strengthening its protocols when it comes to enforcing various regulatory compliance.  These mechanisms put in place serve multi-purpose benefits to the state, industry and consumers.</p>

			<p>For us to achieve the optimum consumer satisfaction and to ensure that other stakehoders are gaining the maximun benefits from the Authority's work, we have over the past years initiated some new regulatory interventons in some cases and also improve other to bring them to global standards.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<p>Some ot the regulatory interventions we have improved on for the benefit of consumers include; Intergrated Commmunication Monitoring Strategies in the areas of (Quality of Service, Cybersecurity, and Spectrum Management), Type Aproval and Capacity Building Initiatives with the International Telecommunications Union (ITU)</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Integrated communication Monitoring Strategies</h3>
			<h5><b>Quality of Service (Voice and Data)</b></h5>
			<p>This is a very important addition to our enforcemnet tools.  Consumers' legitimate demands for improved quality of service and experience has meant that the Authority takes the needed step to ensure that we are able to scientifically measure the output of telecommunications services.  This way, the regulator is able to call defaulting mobile network operators to oreder whiles ensuring that consumers get the best of what they pay for.  Ghana's progress in this direction has seen us collaborating with the International Telecommunications Union to offer quality of service training to professionals within the ITU fraternity.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h5><b>Cybersecurity</b></h5>
			<p>Cybersecurity incidents in the telecammunications sector have heightened the urgency of securing this sector by building cybersecurity capacity, reducing vulnerabilities, reducing malicious activity, proactively dealing with cybersecurity issues, cooperating towards cybersecurity, responding and recovering from cyberscurity incidents.  As the National Cybersecurity Secretariant intensifies its work through the various sectoral Computer Emergency 
			Response Teams (CERT), the NCA is proud to have made some useful strides in this direction.  We are not where we want to be yet, but we surely are on the right path.  Unknowing to the telecommunication consumer in Ghana, the NCA-CERT has prevented a number of potentially in malicious activities which would have had dire consequences on their interest usage.</p>

			<h5><b>Spectrum Management</b></h5>
			<p>One of the most fundamental mandates of the National Communications Authority is the management of spectrum.  It is also one of the most critical and finite resources.  Therefore its maangement is one that requires tact, thoughtfulness and a combiantion of attributes that satisfy the State, Industry and Consumers.  The Authority has strengthened the various mechanisms to monitor Ghana's spectrum to ensure that it is put to maximum use.  These are state of the tools which have made our engineers better equipped to deal with their mandate.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Type Approval (Conformance)</h3>
			<p>The issue of standardisation is one the regulators on the continent and across the world take very seriously.  The potential effect of sub-standard equipment on the population and industry is one that cannot be igored.  One of the often misconstrued 'perceptions' about this industry has got to do with emissions and its impact on consumers.  We are happy as the Regulator to have installed a set of laboratories that can allow us monitor and enforce regulations on this.  Additionally, Ghana is proud to join the elite group of countries that have this facility globally - indeed we are the only ones with this in West Africa.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<h3>Capacity Building Initiatives With The International Telecommunications Union (ITU)</h3>
			<p>It is important to take congnisance of the that, in ensuring and enforcing Regulatory Compliance in Ghana's Communications Industry, the NCA has equipped its staff with the requisite trainings to execute this mandate.  The verve and determination shown by the hardworking men and women of this Authority is what has resulted in the recongnition of the staff and indeed Ghana at various international platforms including the International Telecommunications Union, Africa Telecommunications Union, among others.  The Authority will continue to execute its mandate to the full, as it continues to help shape the digitisation plan of the country.</p>
