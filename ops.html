			<p>Continuing a process which started about a decade ago but which has been given real focus under the leadership of the current Director General - Mr. Joseph Anokye, we have successfully decentralised our technical field operations to a number of regional capitals and this has gone a long way to enhance the execution of the mission of the National Communication Authority (NCA).</p>

			<p>Spectrum management is very important to us here at the NCA.  Spectrum which practically is a finite resource, has to be monitored and managed well for the benefit of all our stakeholders.  Accordingly, we continue to refine our processes and systems to do this work well.  A key part of the refinement of processes, is the decentralisation of our field (Zonal) operations with eight offices throughout the country.</p>

			<p>Having State-of the Art systems to monitor and ensure compliance to regulatory requirements for the benefit to be a World-Class regulator and maintain our hard-won reputation as a leading regulator in Africa, is a key commitment.</p>
		</div>
		<div class="box">
			<p>Under the current leadership, we are investing in these systems not just in our Corporate Head Office but across our decentralised operations in various regional capitals, giving us unprecedented monitoring presence throughout the country. Our main goal here is to improve the quality of telecommunication services for the people of Ghana.</p>
